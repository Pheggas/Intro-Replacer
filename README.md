# Intro-Replacer
A simple batch script to bunch replace intro from movie or series.

This is my first attempt of scripting in Windows Batch.
If you still doesn't know what this script does then here's the explanation: I wanted to have Shaun The Sheep with dubbed intro but original audio in rest of the episode. As the every series has 40+ episodes, do it manually would take large amount of time. Every episode has exactly the same lenght of intro. That's why i made this script.

With MkvMerge, this script is able to cut out the original intro part and replace it with dubbed one. You'll achieve to have dubbed intro + original lang rest of episodes.
